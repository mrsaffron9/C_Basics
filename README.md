# C_Basics

I built my foundational C programming skills through C Programming For Dummies (Wiley), which gave me hands-on experience with:

    Core concepts like pointers, memory management, and control flow

    Practical debugging techniques

    Writing efficient, structured code

    Applying C to system-level projects
